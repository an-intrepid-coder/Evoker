### A Command-Based, Procedural Text Adventure. 

**Description**: The idea is for this to be a fully procedural puzzle-based game that is both challenging and different every time; like a cross between a Roguelike, a Metroidvania, a MUD, and Myst. It is in the very earliest stages. Many fundamental systems are in place, but there isn't much of a game yet. I started making this while on vacation with my laptop just for giggles, but it has turned into a really neat project that I would like to see through and take further. Down the road I will plug in some kind of graphical front-end; most likely `Compose Multiplatform`.
